pyRes is a project designed to make processing superconducting resonator data as painless as possible.

To get started, check out the example notebooks.

If you want to write custom code to load in some type of file that is not a modern Agilent PNA, you'll need a custom process_file function.

Short description of files:
pyRes.py - The main workhorse
containers.py - Some extra code to make organizing things easy with lots of data
process_file.py - Get data into pyRes
fitsS21 - directory containing fit functions for resonator data
fitsSweep - directory containing fit functions for more complicated things
resMCMC.py - experimental code for integrating emcee with pyRes. No longer used now that lmfit has this implemented directly.
Example1 - Start here!
Example2 - Then do this one!
ExampleData.zip - A ton of actual superconducting resonator data from a Nb microstrip resonator made at ANL

Feedback is always appreciated.
