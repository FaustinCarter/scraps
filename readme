pyRes is a project designed to make processing superconducting resonator data as painless as possible.

To get started, check out the example notebooks (you'll need to install iPython and Jupyter) and do the exercises.

If you want to write custom code to load in some type of file that is not a modern Agilent PNA, just add it to the process_file.py file as a new function.

Short description of files:
pyRes.py - The main workhorse
containers.py - Some extra code to make organizing things easy with lots of data
process_file.py - Ways to get data into pyRes
fitsS21 - directory containing fit functions for resonator data
fitsSweep - directory containing fit functions for more complicated things
resMCMC.py - experimental code for integrating emcee with pyRes
Example1 - Start here!
Example2 - Then do this one!
ExampleData.zip - A ton of actual superconducting resonator data from a Nb microstrip resonator made at ANL


Feedback is always appreciated.
