Installation
============
You can use ``pip install scrap``, but since you probably want to play with the
code and make lots of changes, a better way is to clone the git repository to
myDirectory, and then run ``pip install -e path_to_myDirectory``. This way you
can edit the source and enjoy those changes without having to reinstall.
